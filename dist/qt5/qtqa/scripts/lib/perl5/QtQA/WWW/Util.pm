=head1 NAME

QtQA::WWW::Util - utility methods for dealing with web services

=head1 METHODS

Methods are not exported by default; they may be exported individually,
or all together by using the ':all' tag.

=over

=item www_form_urlencoded( key1 => $val1, key2 => $val2 ... )

Given a hash, returns a string representation in application/x-www-form-urlencoded format.
Useful for constructing the body of an HTTP POST normally filled by a web form.

  my $postdata = www_form_urlencoded(id => 1234, request => 'do this; do that' );
  # $postdata eq 'request=do+this%3B+do+that&id=1234'

=item blocking_http_request( $method => $url, key => value... )

Like http_request from L<AnyEvent::HTTP>, but blocks until the request is complete and returns
the result rather than invoking a callback.

Blocking is achieved by the usage of L<Coro>, so use this only if your application is Coro-aware.

=item fetch_to_scalar( $url )

Do an HTTP GET on the given URL and return the fetched content. Croaks on error.

Note: uses L<Coro>.

=item fetch_json_data( $url )

Do an HTTP GET on the given URL, parse the fetched content as JSON and return the parsed object.
Croaks on error.

Note: uses L<Coro>.
